The Group1-6 .amxd's are the audio outputs for each group. If u don't load them, you won't get audio for those groups (or led movement). re:mix is multichannel so u load these on separate audio tracks. u can change the color of your group output tracks to color-code your groups on the re:mix interface.

midi.amxd- recieves all press data and sends it out as midi (if midi out is enabled). you can also send midi to the midi.amxd to trigger press data. since midi only has 128 values, you need to use the midi2.amxd for the bottom 8 rows of a 256.
