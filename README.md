note- there's currently a bug with max 6.1.9's polybuffer~ object where saving mp3's to .wav/.aiff doesn't work properly. contacted c74.

for now crop/save is .aiff only, which does seem to work with mp3's, but u can't preview the crops in ableton's file browser for some reason. (says "file corrupted or not liscensed")
